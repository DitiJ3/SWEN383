# SWEN383
A repo for every project i do in the Design Principles and Patterns
There will be a branch for each assignment we do in class.
To clone the assignment you need then change the branch when you clone with git checkout <branch-name>
Do not push code into this repo I will also add rules to this so if anyone knows a better solution I will review the PR and merge if its good.
