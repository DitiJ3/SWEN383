# SWEN383
A repo for every project i do in the Design Principles and Patterns
There will be a branch for each assignment we do in class.
To clone the assignment you need then change the branch when you clone with git checkout <branch-name>
Do not push code into this repo I will also add rules to this so if anyone knows a better solution I will review the PR and merge if its good.


---- For repo owner ----
1. git init
2. git add .
3. git commit -m "initialising repo"
4. git remote add origin https://github.com/DitiJ3/SWEN383.git
5. git checkout -b <branch-name>
6. git push -u origin <branch-name>

This creates a repo locally then connects it to the origin on github while checking out a unique branch for the project.
After this step:
1. Git status # Git fetch or pull might be needed  
2. git add . #or specific files
3. git commit -m 'message'
4. git push
